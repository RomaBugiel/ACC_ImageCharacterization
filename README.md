# ACC_ImageCharacterization
Automated characterization of nanomaterials in SEM/TEM images using deep learning (PyTorch, Keras)

Development of deep learning models (e.g. U-Net) for segmenting and classifying nanomaterial structures in SEM/TEM images. The project focuses on identifying usable images, detecting particle counts, material types, and structural patterns. Designed to accelerate materials analysis workflows in research or industrial settings.
